## Importing the LocoDrive

As rust is able to use GitHub repositories directly as dependencies you can simply add 
`locodrive = { git = "https://github.com/juhu1705/locodrive.git" }` to your `Cargo.toml`

## Using the LocoDrive

The LocoDrive has the struct `loco_controller::LocoDriveController` made for connecting to a model railroad over a serial port.
This reader will care of parsing received messages correctly before sending them to you.

## Documentation

The documentation is published [here](https://juhu1705.github.io/locodrive/doc/locodrive)
